<h3>🎨 Creative Works &amp; Communication</h3>
<hr />
<p>
  I enjoy visual storytelling, content design, and creating materials that make ideas
  easier and more engaging to understand. During my undergraduate years, I actively 
  participated in design, writing, and media production for multiple student organizations.

    Contributed to the <strong>Sichuan University Overseas Study College WeChat official account</strong>,
    including article writing, layout design, and content planning.
  </li>

  <li>
    Operated and designed content for the <strong>RoboMaster team WeChat official account</strong>,
    including promotional posters, team updates, and short videos.
  </li>

  <li>
    Designed posters, event banners, and visual assets for student organizations, 
    including robotics lectures, lab open days, competitions, and community events.
  </li>

  <li>
    Participated in event planning and creative direction for technical talks, 
    outreach activities, and recruitment events.
  </li>

  <li>
    Won <strong>First Place</strong> in the <strong>Resume Design Competition</strong> at Sichuan University,

  These experiences shaped my interest in combining engineering with design, 
  and strengthened my ability to communicate complex ideas through visual and narrative storytelling.
