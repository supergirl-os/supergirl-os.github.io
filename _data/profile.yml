  <p>
    I am a third-year Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at the <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank">University of California, Santa Cruz</a>, advised by <a href="http://www.yliuu.com/" target="_blank">Yang Liu</a>. 
    My research currently focuses on <strong>LLM alignment and safety, LLM Reasoning, and responsible LLM agents</strong>. I also work on LLM unlearning. I study how to adapt and control LLMs to ensure safe, robust,
    and reliable behavior. My long-term goal is to develop safe, robust, generalizable, and trustworthy LLM-based systems.
    I have been working as a Research Scientist Intern focusing on conducting high impact research in the Generative AI space at <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/data-ai/" target="_blank">Accenture Data & AI Research Center</a> since June 2024.
  </p>
  <p>
    More about my research interests: <br/>
    • LLM Alignment, Unlearning, Reasoning, and Post-training <br/>
    • LLM Agents: Safe, scalable, and trustworthy LLM-based agentic systems <br/>
    • Trustworthy Machine Learning: Fairness, Interpretability, Robustness <br/>
    • Representation Learning & Learning from Dynamic and Noisy Data <br/><br/>

    I am interested in building intelligent agents or models that can learn from various data sources (e.g., images, audio, and text) and automate decision-making processes in uncertain environments to solve multiple real-world tasks realiably and efficiently.
    I love the process of giving machines the intelligence to address real-world problems.
