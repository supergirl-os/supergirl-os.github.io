        I am an undergraduate in Computer Science and Technology (Top-notch Program) of Sichuan University and will graduate in June 2023. During the university, I have been engaged in research in CV, NLP, SLAM, etc., and participated in a number of related competitions, and achieved good results. My current advisor is teacher Zhao Qijun（http://www.scubrl.org/qjzhao） from the School of Computer Science. I think that at the undergraduate level, you should have extensive exposure and study in various fields in order to find the research direction you are most interested in. In the future, I hope to become a PhD student studying autonomous driving. I firmly believe that "learning is endless, and it feels addictive to keep fulfilling and challenging yourself."
